# Division
Division program for an MIPS. (Works in syncsim)

The program is made for Syncsim Mips. It make an division on only positive numbers.

To build and use the code us the make file that will create and OBJ file. 
Run this in Syncsim so you can run the program.

To test your own numbers just change the main where you find the lines that set the a1 and a0.
Those are sent to the div function with a bal command. a0 is the number you want to divied and
a1 is with what.

After the function is done with its calculations it will returne the value on v0 and the rest on v1.
